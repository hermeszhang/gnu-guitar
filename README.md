GNU Guitar
==========

GNU Guitar is a free, cross platform application for manipulating guitar audio in real time.

### Building on Linux

In the source directory, run the setup script.

```
./setup.bash
```

That should install the project into a directory called 'package'.

The executables can be found in `package/bin`.

```
./package/bin/gnu-guitar-qt
```

### Building on Windows

Building on Windows isn't supported yet but will be soon.
