GNU Guitar
==========

GNU Guitar is a free, cross platform application for manipulating guitar audio in real time.

### Building on Linux

In the source directory, run the bash script.

```
./setup.bash
```

That should install the project into a directory called 'package'.

The executables can be found in `package/bin`.

```
./package/bin/gnu-guitar-qt
```

### Building on Windows

In the source directory, run the batch script.

```
.\setup.bat
```

That, like the Linux build, should create a directory called 'package'.

The executable lives in `package\bin`.

```
.\package\bin\gnu-guitar-qt.exe
```
